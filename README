Setup:
    To initialize the environment, and download all required packages;

      make setup

    Make setup requires root for a single command which allows Python to use your bluetooth adapter.

Run:
    MON VALUE	MEANING
    0		monitor off
    1		monitor on

    ARG VALUE	TOP DETECTION	BROADCAST		ROUTING
    0		heartbeat	normal broadcast	broadcast
    1		on change	normal broadcast	direct
    2		on change	optimized broadcast	direct
    3		on change	optimized broadcast	broadcast

    To run this application normally;

      make run MON={} ARG={}

    To run our created application in a simulation using TCP sockets;

      make run-gui-simulation MON={} ARG={}

    where mon specifies whether or not to send data to the monitor/log data.
    Arg specifies which algorithms to use for communication.


If you want to use the !upload command, it takes a file from data/, and sends it to the remote client.
The remote client will then find this file in his local data/.
